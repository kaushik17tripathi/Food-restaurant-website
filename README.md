# Food-restaurant-website

Welcome to  Omnifood! This project showcases my skills in web development and design. It's created solely to exhibit my abilities in creating responsive, interactive websites.

## About 

Omnifood is a concept that highlights a smart food subscription service designed to promote healthy eating. It offers personalized meal plans and convenient meal delivery. 

## How to run locally

To explore this demo project, you can:

1. **Visit the Website**: You can access the live website at https://omnifood-kaushik.netlify.app . Experience the design, user interface, and interactive elements.

2. **Browse the Code**: The source code for this project is available in the repository. Feel free to review the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to understand the structure and functionality.

## Features

This portfolio demo project includes the following features:

- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to work seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

- **Interactive Elements**: Explore how the meal selection and meal approval process works with the help of a sample user interface.

- **Sample Content**: Sample meals, user testimonials, and pricing plans have been included to provide a realistic feel.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that defines the structure of the website.

- `css/`: This directory contains the CSS styles used to format the web page.

- `script/`: The JavaScript files are included for interactive features, even though this is a static demonstration.

- `img/`: Image files are stored here to illustrate the website design and content.

## How to Run Locally

Since this is a static website, you don't need to run it on a server. You can open the `index.html` file directly in your web browser.
